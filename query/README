Defensive Programming
---------------------

1. This program checks that there are 2 arguments passed.
2. This program checks that the [INDEX_FILE] exists.
3. This program checks that the [HTML_DIRECTORY] exists.
4. This program checks that the query line is not empty.
5. This program checks that the query line only contains ASCII characters separated by one whitespace.
6. This program checks for invalid input cases regarding logical operators 
	•	successive logical operators
	•	operator in the beginning of the query line
	•	operator at the end of the query line


-------------------------
Assumptions / Disclaimers
-------------------------

1. I assumed that the Indexer ran successfully, and that the [INDEX_FILE] passed contains
a working InvertedIndex. This [INDEX_FILE] is stored in ../indexer/.

2. I assumed that the Crawler ran successfully, that ./data contains all 1705 crawled webpage files,
and that each file name is a unique integer starting from 1. This [HTML_DIRECTORY] is stored in
../crawler/. 

3. I assumed that [HTML_DIRECTORY] will be inputted without the final '/' for correct parsing.

4. I assumed that the [INDEX_FILE] and the [HTML_DIRECTORY] both have appropriate permissions.

5. I assumed that each query follows the following format: word1 [OPERATOR] word 2 etc.
I assumed that each word or operator is separated by one whitespace ' '.

6. To compute rank for words joined by AND, I added the frequencies up.

7. To compute rank for words joined by OR, I took the maximum of the frequencies.

8. The query line can be at most 1000 characters long.

9. Since crawler, indexer, and query use common files, but with minor changes, I had to
to change the names of a few in order to make them from a single Makefile. For such files, 
I put a 'c', 'i', and 'q' to indicate the files are for crawler, indexer, and query 
respectively. For example, for query, hashtable.c --> qhashtable.c.

10. In my Unit Testing file, queryengine_test.c, I test my display() function that displays
list of matching doc ids and urls to stdout. I did not mute the output to stdout, so 
in the output of queryengine_test.c, please ignore the three lines of doc ids & urls.
