BOUNDARY CASES.
An appropriate error message will be printed for each case.

1.
This tests for the case where the number of arguments passed is not 3.
The program should throw an error.

./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./data
Please input three parameters: seed URL, directory, and max depth.

2.
This tests for the case where the seed URL doesn't have the old-www domain.
The program should throw an error.

./crawler http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./data 0
The seed URL domain must be old-www.

3.
This tests for the case where the directory passed does not exist. './abcdef' does not exist on my machine.
The program should throw an error.

./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./abcdef 0
The directory ./abcdef cannot be found. Please enter an existing directory.

4.
This tests for the case where the directory format is wrong, ie there is a '/' at the end of the path.
The program should throw an error.

./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./data/ 0
Please do not add '/' at the end of the directory path.

5.
This tests for the case where the depth passed is invalid, ie not an integer number.
The program should throw an error.

./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./data 1a
Please input a valid number for the depth.

6.
This tests for the case where the depth passed is greater than the MAX DEPTH of 4.
The program should throw an error.

./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse/ ./data 5
Search depth cannot exceed MAX depth of 4. Please enter a valid depth.

7.
This tests for the case where the seed URL is a dead link, or throws other >400 errors.
The url http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/deadlink.html passed is a dead link.
The program should throw an error.

./crawler http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/deadlink.html ./data 1
The seed URL is invald. Please enter a valid seed URL.



GOOD OUTPUTS.
The last line of 'ls' will be shown to show how many files have been created.
The first 4 lines of a sample file will also be printed to show how each created file should look like.

8.
This tests for depth 0.
Only the seed URL file should be created, with the filename 1.
